# You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '1' and '2'.

# You may delete any number of characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.

# Return the largest possible resultant string that represents an even integer. If there is no such string, return the empty string "".

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "1112"

# Output: "1112"

# Explanation:

# The string already represents the largest possible even number, so no deletions are needed.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "221"

# Output: "22"

# Explanation:

# Deleting '1' results in the largest possible even number which is equal to 22.

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "1"

# Output: ""

# Explanation:

# There is no way to get an even number.
