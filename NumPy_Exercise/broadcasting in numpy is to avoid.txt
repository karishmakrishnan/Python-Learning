broadcasting in numpy is to avoid the use of loop in array
numpy consider array as a batch of chunk and do the operation elements wise at a time.
like if a=[1,2,3]
a*2 ==>[2,4,6]
but broadcasting between array fails if mismatch in dimension or elements
like a=[[1,2],[2,3]] b=[1,2,3] and a+b fails because column of a is not matching with b
